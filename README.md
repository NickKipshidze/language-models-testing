# language-models-testing

Just experimenting with LLMs using Python. 

OtoGPT is a more of a joke program. Its not even a GPT. Someone just asked me to make a Georgian language model so I quickly came up with this idea.

Trigrams is kind of broken. It somewhat works.

The dataset was too large for me to put it here, sorry. ):
